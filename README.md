# CS241
Our little course project: build a compiler from scratch! We implemented a frontend and complete backend. The code generated is highly optimized by the backend and can be run on a native machine.

This project is written by Cheng Cai and 	Norrathep Rattanavipanon.

You should not use it in any way before getting our permit.
