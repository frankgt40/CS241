# CS241 (A toy compiler)
A compiler which compiles a Java-like language program to a set of highly optimized machine code instructions. This compiler is built from scratch without any third party libraries other than Java standard library. We implemented a frontend and a complete backend. The code generated is highly optimized by the backend and can be run on a native machine.
